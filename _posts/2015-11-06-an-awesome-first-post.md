## Changing the Design of Your Site

Now that you have content on your site, The Grid really starts to work its magic. Our AI will continually adjust your site design based on the content you post. The Grid is adaptive, and will update your site's design as you adjust design parameters.

When in the Design section of your site, start by uploading a brand image - this will establish a color palette for your site and allow The Grid's AI to make adjustments that align with the image you choose.

Your site should be unique. That's why you don't see options to choose from. Instead you see spectrums of possibility. Slide them around and watch how the Grid evolves your design accordingly.

1. **Color**: The color slider will change how color is distributed and displayed on your site.
2. **Layout**: The layout slider changes the rhythm and flow of your site. We'll have more changes coming to the layout spectrum options soon!
3. **Type**: The typography slider will allow you to choose a variety of font combinations for your site, from formal to informal.

Occasionally The Grid will apply image filters to conform your content to your color palette.

After changes have been selected and saved, you'll get a notification via The Grid chrome extension that your site redesign is complete.
